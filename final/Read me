//This project implements a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator using C++. 
//RPN is a prefix notation style of computation.
//This means operations are placed before their operands, such as + 5 2 being the equivalent expression to 5+2.
//The design is formally based on the stack data structure. 
//Utilizing the stack's Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) efficiency helps add speed to the calculation.

//The calculator uses two primary stacks to manage the process:
//Input Expression Stack (exp_stack): 
//This stack holds the expression tokens (operators and numbers) loaded manually prior to runtime. 
//It is loaded in reverse order so that the first item popped is the main operation.

//Operand Stack (num_stack): 
//This stack is used during the calculation to temporarily store the Natural numbers (operands) until they are needed by an operator.
//The core requirement of this assignment is to infer the quantity and type of data from the operation given on the first pop. 
// This is handled within the main calculate loop:

//Inferring Quantity
//1.The first thing popped from the exp_stack is a token.
//2.The program checks if this token is an operator (+, -, \*, /).
//3.If it is an operator, the program immediately infers a quantity of two operands are needed, because all standard arithmetic operators used here are binary.
//4.These two necessary operands are then popped from the num_stack. The operation is performed, and the single result is pushed back.

//Inferring Type
//The assignment specifies only using Natural numbers for now.
//Any token popped that is not an operator is therefore inferred to be a Natural number.
// This token is converted from a string format into the C++ integer (int) type using std::stoi() before being pushed onto the num_stack.

//This focus on stack logic and making assumptions based on the operator fulfills the evaluation criteria.
